# Kaggle-.-Mushroom-Classifier

Mushroom Classification
Safe to eat or deadly poison?

Given a set of 23 features of over 8000 labeled mushroom observations (edible/poisonous) the goal is to build a classifier that can accurately predict if a mushroom is safe to eat or no.

This repo contains the classifier I have built for this problem which employs a XGBoost boosted random forest classifier.
